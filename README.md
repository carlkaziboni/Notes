# 📝 NotesKeeper - Android Notes App

## Overview
NotesKeeper is a sleek, minimalist note-taking application built with modern Android development practices. This project demonstrates implementation of Android architecture components with a focus on clean code and user experience.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete notes
- 📱 Clean, intuitive Material Design interface
- 💾 Persistent storage using Room Database
- 🔄 Real-time updates with RecyclerView
- 🧵 Background thread processing for database operations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Architecture Components**
  - Room Database - For local data persistence
  - RecyclerView - For efficient list display
  - ConstraintLayout - For responsive UI design
  - ViewBinding - For type-safe view access

- **Languages & Tools**
  - Java
  - XML
  - Android Studio
  - Gradle

## 📐 Architecture
The app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Model**: Room Database entities and DAOs
- **View**: Activities, Fragments, and XML layouts
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and handles business logic

## 🔍 Code Highlights

### Room Database Implementation
```java
@Entity(tableName = "NotesTable")
public class Note {
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
    public int id;

    @ColumnInfo(name="text")
    public String text;
}
```

### DAO Interface
```java
@Dao
public interface NoteDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM NotesTable")
    List<Note> getAll();
    
    // Other CRUD operations
}
```

### RecyclerView Adapter
```java
public class NotesAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<NotesAdapter.NoteViewHolder> {
    // Efficient list display with ViewHolder pattern
}
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Note categories/tags
- Rich text formatting
- Cloud sync
- Dark mode support
- Search functionality

## 👨‍💻 Development Journey
